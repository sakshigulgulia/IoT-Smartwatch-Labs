# IoT-Smartwatch-Labs

EECS 4764 IoT course lab work at Columbia University in collaboration with Rahul Shanbhag and Prathamesh Sahasrabudhe. 
In these labs we work with Feather Huzzah ESP8266. 

Lab 1

  Checkpoint 1: Continuously blink a morse code message through the HUZZAH using an LED.
  
  Checkpoint 2: Simultaneously blink two separate LEDs at different rates without using interrupts or timers.
  
Lab 2

  Checkpoint 1: Change the brightness of an LED and the pitch of a piezo in accordance to readings from the light sensor. For example, the more light that                 reaches the sensor, the brighter the LED shines and the higher the pitch from the piezo will be.
  
  Checkpoint 2: Debounce a button press. At most, an interrupt should be generated once when the button is pushed and once when the button is let go.
  
  Checkpoint 3: Create the combined system; the system is activated when the button is pressed and deactivated when released. While activated, the LED and                 piezo changes brightness and pitch depending on the light sensor readings.
  
Lab 3

  Checkpoint 1: Display the time on OLED display; the time should update like a regular watch. Be able to change time through the OLED display buttons.
  
  Checkpoint 2: Adjust screen brightness based on ambient light.
  
  Checkpoint 3: Add alarm functionality; Set the alarm through OLED display and when the alarm goes off, a visual and audio notification should go off.
  
  Checkpoint 4: Combine 1, 2, and 3.

Lab 4

  Checkpoint 1: On top of the combined system from lab 3, implement text scrolling based on accelerometer readings.
  
  Checkpoint 2: Interface with a Geolocation API and display your coordinates on the OLED display.
  
  Checkpoint 3: Feed your coordinates into an API to receive information about the weather in your area; display the results on your OLED display.
  
  Checkpoint 4: Post a tweet from the ESP8266. An example tweet could be your location coordinates with the weather in that location. Also, open Twitter                   website or app with your PC or phone to show the tweets.
